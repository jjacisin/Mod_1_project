1. NYC Crime Data

3. Use Current YTD data (as of 11/1/2018):
  --https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243

4. Explore: Map and group data by crime type/location (other groupings?)
  --Download to csv for review
  --JJ Thought: Are other years available for review (Say, since 2013?)
    JJ 11/12 -- Database took longer than expected, not enough time to do multiple years

5. Once determined: Create classes using SQLAlchemy
      --Think about how

6. Determine which method of plotting works

End Goal. Map chosen crime statistic/statistics
  --See Folium method provided by Forest
  --Read Sachia's blog post


Other thoughts:
  --table of five columns
  --group Data
  --about three difference tables (JJ to CB: We might want to think about how to group data, perhaps by boroughs?)
    --Is there a canned way to
  --write out plain SQL in SQLAlchemy
  --find initial data set, make it easy to explore
